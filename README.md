# Bingo_Board
Welcome to the Bingo Board project!
 
Here we are creating a program that allows a user to create a bingo board using any values, size, or scoring features they desire. The program will provide the randomization, dimensions, etc. and the user will provide the details.
 
Two options for end results will be static printable boards, as well as a game in either Desktop or Web App form.
 
The plan is to program this in C#. (Don't let the "Java" on the project folder deceive you).

**Please see the spec sheet for more details.**
