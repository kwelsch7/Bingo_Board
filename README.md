NOTE -- This is actually not an assignment. It's an early version I started of a now-current (10/24/16) project in C#.

Welcome to Bingo Board!

Here I will be creating a bingo board based on the topic of User choice.
Input (the values to go in the squares) is received from either manual input by the user, from a text file, or a from a database.
The values are randomized and then assigned to a square until the given dimensions (also specified by the user) are filled.
I will be teaching myself how to use JavaFX for the display and also how to connect a MySQL Database to Java.
