**Note: Feel free to offer suggestions or edits to how we want to go about/approach this or any extra features you want to add.**

Idea:  Allow user to create a bingo board using any values, size, or scoring features they desire. The program will randomize the values for mass printing where each board is (presumably) unique, or for a single board that can be played as a desktop app.

Example:  A biology teacher wants students to practice vocabulary words about the parts of a cell. The teacher provides:

  nucleus, plasma membrane, mitochondrion, cytoplasm, ribosome, lysosome, peroxisome, centriole, golgi complex, rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, nucleolus
  (12 total values)

The board might look like (but with a real border, not plus's and minus's):
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|     cytoplasm     |      nucleus      | rough endoplasmic |     centriole     |
|                   |                   |     reticulum     |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|  plasma membrane  |      ribosome     |   golgi complex   |     peroxisome    |
|                   |                   |                   |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+
|smooth endoplasmic |   mitochondrion   |      lysosome     |     nucleolus     |
|     reticulum     |                   |                   |                   |
+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

Language:  C#

Input:  Manual (ask user one-by-one until they indicate they are finished), .txt, .csv, Database

Dimensions: Rectangle or Square
  -Enter columns and rows manually
  -Suggest dimensions by rounding down to the nearest square/rectangle (keeping the shape nearly square -- if you are given 39 values, you don't want to suggest 3 X 13 nor round down to 2 X 19). Each board will then have less values than the total pool (so if I word/term is called, not everyone will be placing a tile down).
  -Suggest by rounding up, keeping similar features as in the round-down explanation. Note that on both, the values are suggested and can still be edited (perhaps have an option that if you increase one [rows/columns], the other repopulates). Each board will have duplicate values from the total pool/set, but not necessarily the same ones as each other.
  -An option to have the center square be a free space if there are an odd number of spaces.

Display            -Header Bar or no (to Display a title; eg. "Bio Bingo!")
(Results/Board):   -Fonts, font-size, italics, bold, color, etc.
                   -Themes available (suggested color/font combos, like in MS Office)
                   -Starting suggestion a plain theme that's easy on the printer
